An interactive web application that visualizes the process of solving Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm.  
I built this project to strengthen my understanding of recursion and algorithmic problem-solving. Watching the solver progress cell by cell helped me grasp how backtracking operates in practice‚Äîhow it makes decisions, handles constraints, and backtracks when it hits a dead end.

## ‚ú® Features

- Responsive 9x9 Sudoku grid generated dynamically with real-time visual feedback.
- Intuitive user interface built with HTML and CSS for a clean and accessible experience.
- Interactive keyboard-based input with live validation and error-prevention logic.
- Automated puzzle generation ensuring valid, solvable boards through randomized number placement and constraint checks.
- Step-by-step visualization of the backtracking algorithm with asynchronous execution and dynamic rendering.
- Configurable solving speed using adjustable delay intervals (e.g., slow, average, fast, instant) to observe algorithmic flow.
- Success-state detection triggering visual effects (confetti animation) upon correct puzzle completion.
- Full puzzle controls, including grid reset, solve-on-demand, and regeneration of new board states.
- Robust input validation preventing illegal number placement and maintaining puzzle consistency.
